# Auction simulation website

![image](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/swgXbjHzapYF.png?o=1)

Here I have built an auction website, where people can register an account, create their own listings and bid on other people's listings.

## Description

When someone first registers they will be given a credit of 1000. On this website the currency is cookies.
If you make a bid and win the bidding war you will be deducted credit. If you create a listing and someone bids on this, the winning bid amount will be added to your credit.

Registered and logged in users can:

- View all listings
- View all listings by other users
- Create listings
- Bid on listings
- Search through listings
- Sort listings
- Upload and change their profile picture

Unregistered users can:

- View all listings
- View single listing
